## TODO

- [x] Dynamic CSS loading with respect to the selected theme
- [x] Download or link [all supported themes](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/styles)
- [ ] Pretty popup selection
- [x] Build step that fetches highlight.js
    - All themes are available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highlight.js?activeTab=readme) and can be fetched at build time.
- [x] Popup should automatically list all themes
- [ ] Avoid freezing the window with [Web Workers](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js?tab=readme-ov-file#using-web-workers)
